## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- NodeJS
- EJS
- ExpressJS
- API


### What I learned

I got to know about some of the built-in functions of javascript. Till now, I have been using only NodeJS to build my projects. But in this project, I came to know about some of the javascript functions such as fetch() etc.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.chat.openai.com) - As we all know, ChatGPT is super helpful in all of the fields. It helped me out to figure out how can I make my program do a specific function, which I didnt knew before. That function is obivously fetch, as I talked earlier before.

## Acknowledgments

Yes, I can say that it is not for absolute beginners, but you can tackle it if you have made and practised a few programs before. Not that difficult. Good luck!
